# Usage Examples

## Basic Usage

# Generate with defaults (light theme, center alignment)
./banner-gen ./my-project

# Generate with specific theme
./banner-gen ./my-project dark
./banner-gen ./my-project muted
./banner-gen ./my-project light

# Generate with specific alignment
./banner-gen ./my-project light left
./banner-gen ./my-project light center
./banner-gen ./my-project light right

# Combine theme and alignment
./banner-gen ./my-project dark left
./banner-gen ./my-project muted right

## README.md Format

Your project's README.md should contain:

```markdown
# My Project
<!-- banner-title: My Project Name -->
<!-- banner-tagline: Optional tagline or description -->

Rest of your README...
```

## Using Nerd Font Icons

Include Nerd Font icons directly in banner-title or banner-tagline:

```markdown
<!-- banner-title: RocketApp  -->
<!-- banner-tagline: Fast as lightning  -->
```

Get icons from: https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet

## Output

The command generates two files in your project directory:
- banner.svg (always generated)
- banner.png (requires PNG conversion implementation)

## Testing with Original Test Projects

```bash
# Test with Nerd Font icons
./banner-gen ~/work/banner-kit/test-projects/nerd-icon-example

# Test with emoji
./banner-gen ~/work/banner-kit/test-projects/emoji-test dark

# Test with real projects
./banner-gen ~/work/banner-kit/test-projects/vibetunnel muted
./banner-gen ~/work/banner-kit/test-projects/verlihirsh-toolkit light left
```

## Make Targets

```bash
make build    # Build binary
make test     # Generate banners for all test projects
make clean    # Remove binary and generated banners
make install  # Install to ~/bin or /usr/local/bin
make run      # Build and show usage
```

## Comparing with Node.js Version

```bash
# Generate with Go version
./banner-gen ./test-project light center

# Generate with Node.js version
node ~/work/banner-kit/scripts/generate-banners.mjs ./test-project light center

# Compare SVG output (should be identical)
diff test-project/banner-go.svg test-project/banner-js.svg
```
